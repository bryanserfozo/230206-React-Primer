# React Component Life Cycle

Class based components have built in lifecycle methods for `Mounting`, `Unmounting`, `Updating`, and `Error Handling`

The constructor is primarily used for initalizing data in a component

componentDidMount is primarily used for grabbing/fetching data after the page loads (component loads)

componentWillUnmount is primarily used for clean when a component is being destroyed

Function based components don't extend React Component Class, so they did not have direct access to these until React version 16.8 when we introduced hooks

# State in React

State stores information/data about the component, it is completely encapsulated in the component.
- No outside component can access the state of another component, unless nested and passed as a prop

State is special because it cannot be mutated directly, you must use the correct mutators/hooks

## Immutablity of State in React

To set state in a class, you use the constructor, or a declare a field called state, then to mutate, you use the this.setState method of the React component class

To set state in a function component, you use the useState hook provided by React

# Data Binding

In React we can inject a variable value into a components JSX with curly braces `{varname}` this is considered data binding

# Nested Components

React allows for components to be nested inside one another, this can create a bit of a hierarchy, or parent child relationships

Parent components can share state with their child through something called props

# Props:
how we pass data from one parent component to a child component, we include the prop we want to pass down in the child components tag

Props are immutable, they cannot be changed inside of the child class

## One-way data flow

In React data can only flow one way, from the top down

You can only pass props from a parent to child, not the other way around, without doing some fancy magic called "Lifting State"

# Hooks

built in functions that allow us to "hook" into React state and lifecycle methods from functional components

This gave function components the same amount of power as class based

## Basic Hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer

useState:
- allows you to store and mutate state inside of a function component
- declare a state variable and a mutator inside of square brackets, then use the `useState(defaultVal)` to set the state orginally
    - `const [state, setState] = useState("")`
- use the declared mutator to change and update the state
- with useState, the state does not have to be an object like it does in classes

useEffect:
- allows you to perform some logic at a specific point in the applications life
- its takes in a callback function that performs logic
- it can be used to watch for specific events/changes in state to perform some logic
- If you only want it to run once at the beginning of the components life, you can give it an empty array
- You can watch specific state members, by adding them to the array

useContext:
- used to access values being stored in the ContextAPI
- Context is a way to store application state

useReducer:
- used as an advanced in component state manager, could also be used in conjunction with the Context API
- Instead of storing just a state value, it also takes in a reducer function, which describes how the states data should be modified

# Create Function based components in React

# Event Handling in React

Event handing in React is similar to HTML, however, with JSX you must use camelCase for the event name, and pass the handler as a JS reference rather than a string

## Synthetic Events
cross browser wrapper around browsers native event, this is used when an event occurs in React

Used because it is capable of pooling, which means the SyntheticEvent Objects are reused to improve performance, however, issues can arise because after the callback is called the properties are nullified

# React Conditional Rendering

In React we can decide if/when components should be displayed with conditional rendering

You will typically see conditional rendering looking at some state of a parent component, and either Render the child component or render nothing using a ternary operator

# Mapping Elements from a list

If you want to render a list of elements in React, it is typically done with the `.map()` function on the array object

However, React expects you to prive a unique key for each element that you are mapping through
- This helps React identify which items have been changed, added, or removed

The only time you should use an index (of the array) as a key, is when you have no other options
