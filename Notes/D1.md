# Single Page Applications

Single Page Applications or (SPA's) are webapps that render on a single page in the browser

All of our Javascript, HTML, and CSS are loaded in and ready for the browser in one page load

During navigation, the browser never refreshes because you stay on the same page

We will use React to create our SPA's

The advantages of SPA's

-   Fast and responsive
-   Caching capability
-   Pleasant user experience across multiple platforms

Disadvantages

-   Don't perform well with SEO
-   Less secure against Cross-site scripting
-   The page may take longer to load initially

# React Overview

React is a lightweight, Javascript **Library** created in 2011 by Facebook. It is meant to be used in conjunction with other modules for the purpose of creating frontend user interfaces for web application

## Framework vs Library

Frameworks are an entity that takes your code and executes a lot of abstracted away processes

While the pros for a framework are that they do a lot of work from you, the cons include:
- more features, bloat the size of the framework
- less flexible with how featurs are used
- must use the entire framework for one feature
- less customizable

React is a library, is only designed to enable users to declaritively describe their user interfaces
- it doesn't benefit from the opionated nature of framework
- smaller/less bulky because it is only made to do one thing
- use other libraries/modules that you NEED to expand the functionality
- instead of a framework doing everthing for you, the developer is responsible for connecting each component

## Tradeoffs and Cons of React

React doesn't use HTML templates, you simply write your compontents in a JS/TS file, this means you must have a better understanding of JS/TS

React doesn't follow a traditional MVC design pattern, all data for a component is stored in that opne file, the components should be separated by concern

React uses JSX instead of HTML, and JSX differs slightly from HTML, so must learn the new syntax

React versioning is updated frequently so version changes and forward compatibility need to be taken into account

Online resources for React could be outdated (stackoverflow posts)

Since React is so flexible, there can be a lot of decision fatigue. There are a lot of choices you have to make, which normally fall into these categories
- What dev environment
- Class of functional components
- Types, States and Styling

# create-react-app

The easiest way to create a new React application is with the `create-react-app` CLI

Install it with `npm i -g create-react-app`

To actually create your react app:

`npx create-react-app name-of-app`

When we use create-react-app it will create a newly generated React application that comes preconfigured with the baseline dependencies such as babel, webpack, jest, and more

## React with Typescript vs Javascript

React provides the flexibility to use either Javascript or Typescript to build components, and the create-react-app tool allows you to create an app for Typescript out of the box

We will be using Typescript to develop our react application

You can either create a react app with the typescript template, or install the typescript module for react

`npx create-react-app name-of-app --template typescript`

Or to convert an existing application:

`npm i --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest`

Then create the tsconfig

`npx tsc --init`

Then finish up with setting the applications configs however you like

## Special React Type Definitions

Since typescript is known for its static typing, when you setup react to work with Typescript, you also have to install the special types as we saw above, and we will see these soon

# React Component Architecture
a software architecture that focuses on breaking the application into inidividual functional or logical components

These components communicate with one another to create a larger application. These components should follow the Single Responsiblity Principle

## Single Responsibility Principle
the programming principle that every module/component should have responsibility over a single part of the applications functionality

Component based architecture helps ensure component resuability, and increased reliablity due to the reuse of existing components

React follows Component Based Architecture, and you should design your components to use the Single Responsiblity Principle

## Functional vs Class Components

Two ways of creating components:
- Traditional class based
- New, recommended way with functions

Back before something known as hooks, function components were not as useful because they did not have access to react life cycle, and could not manage state, but now function components have nearly the same functionality, in less code, and nicer looking code

There is actually talk now, that class components may become deprecated in the future

## React JSX

used to create the template for React components. It looks like HMLT, but it is written inside of javascript. This gets injected into the virtual DOM and diplayed on the browser

JSX uses Babel to compile it to ES6 or ES5 before everything is rendered

JSX unlike HMTL is case sensitive, lowercase tags are rendered as HTLM elements, and Upercase tags are rendered as react components

It is important to remember to wrap your entire JSX in a single root tag, this is because of the way react handles the DOM

## React Virtual DOM

React renders the components in order to display them to the view

Our react components are injected into the root html element to be displayed on the page, in fact we never leave that one html page, we just swap components in the root element of index.html

React uses a virtual DOM to map the components view to the actual DOM object (because we don't actually write HTML in react)

The reason behind a virtual DOM is beause rendering the page, and updating the real DOM is costly in performance

So the virtual DOM is much more lightweight than the actual DOM, which is why React uses it only to update the Real DOM when absolutely necessary

# Class Components Overview

React components start with an Uppercase and follow PascalCase naming convention

Class based are simply Javscript Classes that extend React.Component the class includes:
- render(): returns the JSX that is structure of the component/what it is going to look like
- constructor(): gets called when the component is instantiated, where you might want to initalize any state for your component
    - if you component takes in any properties, use the `super()` in the constructor


```tsx
export class GenericComponent extends React.Component<props:Prop,state:State> {

    state:State = {
        //some default state
    }

    //constructor for passing props, initializing state
    constructor(props:Prop){
        super(props);

        state = {
            //some initialized state
        }
    }

    render(
        return(
            <div>
                The content of the component
            </div>
        )
    )

}
```

# Functional Components in React

React allows you to create components based off of functions
- These are simplier, and more straight forward to write
- With the inclusion of Hooks, functional components are now (almost) as powerful as more bulky class based components
- The only thing with funcion based components, is that they must return JSX/TSX

# React Styling Components

In react we style components the same way we style HTML pages

You can include inline CSS or export the CSS into style sheets which is the preferred method because you can then share styles across multiple components

Since we are styling JSX/TSX and not html the keyword to set a class on an element is `className` instead of just class

To link the CSS to the component you simply use node module imports and it will be linked to the component

```
import './component.css'
```


# React Component Life Cycle

Class based components have built in lifecycle methods for `Mounting`, `Unmounting`, `Updating`, and `Error Handling`

The constructor is primarily used for initalizing data in a component

componentDidMount is primarily used for grabbing/fetching data after the page loads (component loads)

componentWillUnmount is primarily used for clean when a component is being destroyed

Function based components don't extend React Component Class, so they did not have direct access to these until React version 16.8 when we introduced hooks
